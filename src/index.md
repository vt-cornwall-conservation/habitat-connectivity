In October 2023, the Cornwall Conservation Commission accepted a joint proposal to undertake an inventory and assessment of Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Blocks in Cornwall, Vermont submitted by Sophie Mazowita, Jeff Howarth, and Monica Przyperhart.  

Phase 1 consists of the following tasks:  

* compile and analyze available data; 
* conduct public forum and resident interviews; 
* prepare preliminary maps; 
* prioritize sites for field visits.  

The CCC identified the following data sources for compilation and analysis:  

* ANR LIDAR habitat layers, 
* 2020-2023 Cornwall Wildlife Camera Project documentation,
* 2015 Cornwall Ecological Inventory report that includes wildlife comments from residents,
* 2016 Cornwall Values Mapping Workshop maps.  

This site provides technical documentation for the mapping work completed in Phase 1.
