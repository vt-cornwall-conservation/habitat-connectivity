In October 2023, the Cornwall Conservation Commission accepted a joint proposal to undertake an inventory and assessment of Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Blocks in Cornwall, Vermont submitted by Sophie Mazowita, Jeff Howarth, and Monica Przyperhart.  

Phase 1 consists of the following tasks:  

* compile and analyze available data; 
* conduct public forum and resident interviews; 
* prepare preliminary maps; 
* prioritize sites for field visits.  

This site documents map layers developed in Phase 1. You can load the project map into a new tab in your web browser by [clicking here](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/cornwall-connectivity){target=_blank}.
