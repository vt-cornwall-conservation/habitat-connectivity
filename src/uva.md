## Overview  

The **UVA Forestland** layer shows parcels of land enrolled in [Vermont's Use Value Appraisal (Current Use) Program](https://fpr.vermont.gov/forest/UseValueAppraisal){target=_blank} that have forestland requiring a forest management plan. The layer does not include agricultural parcels without forest land.  

## Instructions      

By default, this layer will not draw when the atlas first loads. You can draw the layer by checking **UVA Forestland** in the layer panel.  

## Source  

The data are produced and maintained by the state's Parcel Mapping Program. On 12/12/2023, I accessed the dataset from the [Vermont Open Geodata Portal](https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/VTANR::use-value-appraisal-parcels/about){target=_blank}. I then filtered the dataset for parcels in the study region (within 10 km of Cornwall).
