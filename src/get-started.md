## How to open the atlas    

I find this documentation easiest to read if I do the following:  

  1. reduce the width of my browser window so that it occupies one half or less (1/3) of my screen,  
  
  2. [open the atlas in a new browser tab](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/cornwall-connectivity){target=_blank},

  3. drag the atlas tab so that it sits next to this documentation in the other half of my screen.

## How to control the maps  

In the upper left corner of the map, use the **+ -** buttons to zoom in (+) and out (-). You can also use your mouse or touch pad to zoom. 

Click, hold, and drag the map to pan (change the map's center).  

In the upper right corner, use the **Layers** panel to change map layers. The check box to the left of each layer title controls layer visibility (shows or hides the layer). You can also change the transparency of the layer with the slider that sits to the left of the layer title. The order of the layers in this list follows the 'overlay' metaphor of a stack of maps from top-to-bottom.  

Also in the upper right, click the **Map** or **Satellite** buttons to select a base layer from the drop down list. This is a useful way of finding reference features and names for roads and some creeks; the base layers can help you orient yourself while exploring the map layers. 

The last button in the upper right will expand the atlas window to full screen.  

In the lower right, you can find a tiny scale bar, some metadata about the datasets used for the base layers, and a small, clickable button for keyboard shortcuts.  

A quick click to the map will print the name, address, acreage, and SPAN number of parcels to the panel on the lower left. The selected parcel will appear outlined in yellow. By default, the layer that shows all the parcels will not be displayed when you first load the atlas (I thought it looked too busy when zoomed out), but you can make this layer visible by checking "Cornwall Parcels" in the **Layers** panel if you
