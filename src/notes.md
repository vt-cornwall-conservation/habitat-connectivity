## General questions  

* How does animal movement connect Cornwall to places outside Cornwall? 
    * Where do animals need to move to or come from?  
* How do habitat types differ with respect to the proportion of the year that they provide habitat? 
* What types of human land use may provide food resources or other habitat?

## Black bear   

__Home range__  

* based on "probable normal cruising diameters" from studies in Michigan - average minimum summer range was about six miles, and annual home ranges were in the vicinity of 15 miles (Willey 1976: 8).

    * _set study region as 10km (6 mile) buffer around Cornwall_

__Food cycle:__ 

* _spring:_ foods consist of grasses, sedges, herbs, horsetail, skunk cabbage, acorns, evergreen needles, buds, roots, bulbs, and carrion (Willey 1976: 9.  

* _summer:_ in addition to the spring foods that are still available, summer foods consist of fruiting species and insects, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Willey 1976: 10).    

* _fall:_ an assortment of fruits and nuts; apples, beechnuts, and acorns predominate; grapes when available (Willey 1976: 11).

* _cultural resources:_ orchards, vineyards, apiaries, boneyards, corn, oats. 

__Habitat requirements__  

* tree canopy protection from weather and escape from enemies such as dogs.  

* mixture of conifers, hardwoods, and topographic variations makes the best range; land without conifers does not provide concealment that bears require; rough and wooded topography provides well-drained den sites, well distributed water supply, and solitude.
