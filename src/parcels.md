## Overview  

The parcels layer shows property boundaries for all land parcels within Cornwall and along the town's boundary (in the neighboring towns of Weybridge, Middlebury, Salisbury, Whiting, Shoreham, and Bridport).  

By default, the parcel lines are not drawn when the map first loads. You can draw the parcel lines by checking "Cornwall Parcels" in the layer panel. You can also retrieve information about the owner, acreage, and SPAN number by clicking on a parcel. The information will print to a panel and the selected parcel will be highlighted in yellow.     

## Source

The data are from the [Statewide Property Parcel Mapping Program](https://vcgi.vermont.gov/data-and-programs/parcel-program){target=_blank}. 

I downloaded the statewide dataset on 12/11/2023 from XXXX. On this date, the Town Mapping Status page reported that the recency of data for Cornwall and adjacent towns varied as shown in the table below.  

| TOWN          | RECENCY                   |
| :---          | :---                      |
| Shoreham      | Less than 6 months old    |
| Weybridge     | Less than 6 months old    |
| **Cornwall**  | **6 - 12 months old**     |
| Bridport      | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Salisbury     | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Middlebury    | More than 3 years old     |
| Whiting       | More than 3 years old     |
