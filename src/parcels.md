## Overview  

The **Cornwall Parcels** layer shows boundaries for all land parcels within Cornwall and all parcels along the town's boundary in the neighboring towns of Weybridge, Middlebury, Salisbury, Whiting, Shoreham, and Bridport.  

## Instructions      

By default, the parcel lines will not draw when the atlas first loads. You can draw the parcel lines by checking "Cornwall Parcels" in the layer panel. By clicking on a parcel, you can also retrieve the name of the owner(s), their address, and the parcel's acreage and SPAN number. The information will print to a panel and the selected parcel will be highlighted in yellow. If you tire of seeing the highlighted parcel, you can uncheck the layer's visibility through the **Layers** panel.         

## Source

The data are produced and maintained by the [Statewide Property Parcel Mapping Program](https://vcgi.vermont.gov/data-and-programs/parcel-program){target=_blank}. I downloaded the statewide dataset on 12/11/2023 from the [VT Open Geodata Portal](https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/09cf47e1cf82465e99164762a04f3ce6_0/explore){target=_blank}. On this date, the [Town Mapping Status page](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/d88b19e908a1460da8bcb7326f7c2ec6){target=_blank} reported that the recency of data for Cornwall and adjacent towns varied as shown in the table below. I then filtered the statewide dataset for all parcels that are inside the town of Cornwall or within 50 meters of the town's boundary.

_TABLE 1. Recency of parcel datasets by town._  

| TOWN          | RECENCY                   |
| :---          | :---                      |
| Shoreham      | Less than 6 months old    |
| Weybridge     | Less than 6 months old    |
| **Cornwall**  | **6 - 12 months old**     |
| Bridport      | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Salisbury     | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Middlebury    | More than 3 years old     |
| Whiting       | More than 3 years old     |

## Salt      

_The parcel boundaries in this layer do not represent legal boundaries._    

If you look along the boundary of Cornwall, you will notice that the boundaries of Cornwall parcels often overlap the boundaries of parcels in the adjacent town. This reflects the compilation process of data production (the state program compiles datasets that are produced and maintained by each town) and the tendency of towns in Vermont to do this work in isolation of each other.  

You will also notice that parcel boundaries do not align perfectly with features in other layers, including the town boundary and protected land layers. This again reflects the fact that the parcel, town, and protected land data have different backstories and contain elements that were originally created in isolation of each other.
