## Overview  

The **Cornwall Parcels** layer shows boundaries for all land parcels within Cornwall and along the town's boundary (in the neighboring towns of Weybridge, Middlebury, Salisbury, Whiting, Shoreham, and Bridport).  

## Instructions      

By default, the parcel lines will not drawn when the atlas first loads. You can draw the parcel lines by checking "Cornwall Parcels" in the layer panel. By clicking on a parcel, you can also retrieve the name of the owner(s), their address, and the parcel's acreage and SPAN number. The information will print to a panel and the selected parcel will be highlighted in yellow. If you tire of seeing the highlighted parcel, you can uncheck the layer's visibility through the **Layers** panel.       

## Source

The data are from the [Statewide Property Parcel Mapping Program](https://vcgi.vermont.gov/data-and-programs/parcel-program){target=_blank}. I downloaded the statewide dataset on 12/11/2023 from the [VT Open Geodata Portal](https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/09cf47e1cf82465e99164762a04f3ce6_0/explore){target=_blank}. On this date, the [Town Mapping Status page](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/d88b19e908a1460da8bcb7326f7c2ec6){target=_blank} reported that the recency of data for Cornwall and adjacent towns varied as shown in the table below.

| :---          | :---                      |
| Shoreham      | Less than 6 months old    |
| Weybridge     | Less than 6 months old    |
| **Cornwall**  | **6 - 12 months old**     |
| Bridport      | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Salisbury     | 1 - 2 years old           |
| Middlebury    | More than 3 years old     |
